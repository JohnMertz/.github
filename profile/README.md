# 👋 Hi! 👋

I'm John! Nice of you to come by!

## ✅ What I'm up to ✅

I'm a recent freelance developer after being the lead (often sole) developer for the MailCleaner anti-spam project and it's associated corporate backers, Fastnet then Alinto.

I am fortunate enough to be in a stable enough situation that I'm able to devote a lot of time to development on a recreational basis, as well as pursue other hobbies and projects. Currently  I am:

- 📭 reviving MailCleaner through an entirely open source [fork](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger-Plus) through the new organization [SpamTagger](https://github.com/SpamTagger).
- 🌱 planning [a simplified fork](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger) of MailCleaner which will be more maintainable and dedicated to just filtering email and nothing else.
- ⚛️ playing around with building my own atomic ([aka "immutable"](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/good-explanation-on-why-we-should-use-atomic-instead-of-immutable/1833)) operating systems for [personal use](https://github.com/JohnMertz/dogwood) and for [SpamTagger](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger-Bootc).
- 📨 working on smaller personal coding projects which will see the light of day when they are somewhat less atrocious.
- [practicing](https://github.com/JohnMertz/exercism-solutions), mentoring on and contributing to [Exercism](https://exercism.org).
- 🤝 contributing to other projects when I can.
- 🥼 building out my homelab and smarthome.
- 👷‍♂️ renovating my house to be airtight and as close as is reasonable to net zero.
- 🤖 wordworking, electronics, and other projects.

## ✨What I'm good at ✨

You can look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mertzjohn) for a (slightly) more polished, professional profile. I'm pretty good at, or at least enjoy these things:

- 🐪 Perl - I know it is not sexy anymore, but man is it fun! 
- 🌐HTML/JS - I've been building websites for fun longer than I've done anything else in tech and continue to write them from scratch to this day.
- 🥱 PHP, Python, Shell - Much less enthusiastic about these, but I know how to use them fairly well.
- 🐧 Linux - I've been a full-time Linux nerd for almost 15 years and have spent pretty much my entire working life using, administering and developing in Linux environments.
- 📨 Email - I've spent more than 10 years in email security, including administering various MTAs, IMAP and LDAP servers in a Linux environment.
- 📦 Containers and Virtualization - I live my day-to-day life on my own container-based OS, inside additional development containers, as I build containerized applications and VMs.

## 💬 Where we can chat 💬

I have not really had social media since I got rid of Facebook immediately after high school, so I'm a bit hard to get in touch with. If you want to get in touch with me, I'll probably see your messages on one of these:
